## Introduction

This is my repository where I learn about various machine learning algorithms. 

The folder structure describes what I am interested in learning in the near future.

| Main Folder | Category | Remarks / Status |
| :---: | :----: | :---: |
| Neural Networks: Audio | Loading and Playing Audio | Done, Using IPython and Torch Audio |
|| Fast Fourier Transform | Done, Using SciPy |
|| Training a Model | Done, Binary Classification (Forward, Backwards) |
|| Recording Audio | Planned |
| Neural Networks: Vision | Base / Classification | Planned for learning basic CNN, Residual Blocks, Inception Blocks |
| | Detection | Planned for learning to extend the CNN to be able to do detection |
| | Segmentation | Planned for learning to extend the base modules to be able to do segmentation |
| Neural Networks: Tabular | Nil | Planned for learning to work with Tabular Data |
| Neural Networks: Natural Language Processing | Nil | Planned for learning to work with Natural Language |
| Decision Trees | Nil | Planned for learning Gradient Boosted Decision Trees |
